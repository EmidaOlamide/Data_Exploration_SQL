# Data Exploration with SQL. 
I showcased my **SQL skills by answering the following questions (from simple to difficult questions):  
* Total downloads for Sugar Rush
* Total downloads for C apps
* Uninstalls in December 2021
* Downloads in Oct, Nov, Dec 2021
* How many times we had more than 8000 downloads per app month?
* 5 star rating % for Sugar Rush
* Average uninstalls for Subway Wafers
* Which month has highest uninstall ratio?
* Average monthly downloads
* Most downloads in any month / app? 2nd and 3rd places also?
* Which month and app was that?
* In October 2021, which app has most 1star ratings?
* Does it change by December 2021?
* What are the best download figures for each app?
* What is the least downloaded app in each month? 
 
The table name is sample. And the tool used is MySQL. Check out my sql queries and have fun.  

The dataset and questions were gotten from Chandoo YouTube video, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5hayFelHDU). He answered the questions using **Microsoft Excel**.  

Your feedbacks will be greatly appreciated.
